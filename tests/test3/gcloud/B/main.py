    '''Extract user function input from the request

    unum requires a particular payload format where there is a "Data" field
    that specifies the "Source" and "Value" of the input to user functions.

    On a high level, there are two categories of data sources: http and unum
    intermediary data stores (e.g., s3, dynamodb).

    When the "Source" is "http", the "Value" field contains the actual data
    for user functions. For example,

        {
            "Data": {
                "Source": "http",
                "Value": {
                    "Purchase record": [
                        "ItemA",
                        "ItemB"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }

    We can directly pass the data in the "Value" field to the user function.

    When the "Source" is an unum intermediary data store, the "Value" field
    contains pointers to items in the data store. For example,

        {
            "Data": {
                "Source": "s3",
                "Value": [
                    "ImageResize-unumIndex-0",
                    "FaceRecognition-unumIndex-1"
                ]
            }
        }

    The pointers in the "Value" field should be passed to the `read_input()`
    API of the data store library which will read the data from the data store
    and correctly format it.

    In reality, you'll only see data sources from a data store when the
    orchestration is performing a fan-in where the function's input is the
    output of multiple upstream functions. unum stores each upstream
    function's output in a data store and invokes the fan-in function with the
    pointers when all upstream functions complete.

    The input to the fan-in function in this case is an ordered array of the
    upstream functions' outputs. The order is decided by the upstream
    functions' unum configuration. All upstream functions that are part of the
    fan-in should list outputs in the same order in their configurations.

    User function inputs are always JSON serializables.

    1. Check if a checkpoint already exists.

       This involves computing the instance's unique name and a read from the
       data store.

       This check guards against non-concurrent duplicates, such as retries or
       duplicate invocations that happen after a previous instance completes.

       1. For non-entry functions, non-concurrent duplicates might see
          checkpoints exist. Concurrent duplicates will not see checkpoints
          exist at this point.

       1. For workflow entry functions, this check is always false, even for
          non-concurrent duplicates (e.g., retries, duplicates that happen
          later), because every invocation of the entry function creates a new
          session ID.

    2. If checkpoint does not exist, run the user function and use its result
       as `user_function_output`. If checkpoint does exist, read from the
       checkpoint and use it as `user_function_output`.

    3. Once user function's output is decided, run egress: checkpoint and
       invoke continuations.

       Note that if checkpoint already exists before running the user
       function, we don't need to checkpoint again during egress.
